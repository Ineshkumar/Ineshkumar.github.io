# Terraform drift at scale

Managing Terraform at scale revealed gaps in drift detection and state hygiene.

## Diagnosis
- No consistent automated scanning for drift.

## Fixes
- Introduced scheduled drift scans.

```bash
terraform init && terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform show -json tfplan | jq '.'
```
