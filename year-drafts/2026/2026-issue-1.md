# Observability-first deployments

This draft describes how observability was used to make deployment decisions and protect SLOs.

## Problem
Deployments sometimes increased error rates without immediate visibility.

## Fixes
- Standardized tracing libraries
- Gate deployments with SLOs

```bash
# verify tracing collector is reachable
curl -fsS http://tracing.local/api/health || echo "tracing collector unreachable"
```
